# Semster-Project-2
This is my semester project at Noroff Academy.

Overview
The project appears to be an Auction Website. Users can navigate through different pages, search for items, log in/register, and presumably bid on items.

Technologies Used
HTML5: Used for structuring the website.
Bootstrap 5.0.1: A popular CSS framework used for styling and layout.
Custom CSS: Specific stylings for the website are contained in custom.css.
JavaScript: Dynamic functionalities for login and other user interactions.
Features
Navigation Bar: A consistent navbar is present, with a logo, search bar, and user-related links.
User Banner: Displays user-related information, including an avatar and credit balance.
Login and Registration Forms: Users can log in or register a new account.
New Listing Form: Presumably for users to add new items for auction.
Dynamic Alerts: Alert messages for success or error feedback, probably related to user actions.
Responsive Design: Given the use of Bootstrap and certain CSS stylings, the website is likely responsive and mobile-friendly.
Setup and Installation
To get the project running locally:

Clone the repository.
Open the HTML files in your preferred browser.
Ensure that bootstrap.min.css, custom.css, bootstrap.min.js, login.js, and main.js are correctly linked and present in the project directory.
Status
This is a base version. Future improvements might include backend integrations for real-time auctioning, user profile features, or more detailed item pages.
